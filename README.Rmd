The goal of `anthroplus` is to provide R functions for the application of
the WHO Reference 2007 for 5-19 years to monitor the growth of school-age
children and adolescents.

It is modeled after the [R Macros of the WHO Reference 2007](https://www.who.int/tools/growth-reference-data-for-5to19-years/application-tools).

## Installation

You can install the released version of anthroplus from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("anthroplus")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("worldhealthorganization/anthroplus")
```
## Example

### Z-scores

This function calculates z-scores for the three anthropometric indicators, 
weight-for-age, height-for-age and body mass index (BMI)-for-age.

```{r example}
library(anthroplus)
anthroplus_zscores(
  sex = c("1", "f"),
  age_in_months = c(100, 110),
  height_in_cm = c(100, 90),
  weight_in_kg = c(30, 40)
)
```

The returned value is a `data.frame` that can further be processed or
saved as a `.csv` file.

You can also use the function with a given dataset with `with`

``` r
your_data_set <- read.csv("my_survey.csv")
with(
  your_data_set,
  anthroplus_zscores(
    sex = sex_column, age_in_months = age_column,
    weight_in_kg = weight_column, height_in_cm = height_column,
    oedema = oedema_column
  )
)
```

### Prevalence estimates

The function to compute the prevalence estimates is similar 
to `anthroplus_zscores` in terms of the parameters.

```{r example2}
set.seed(1)
anthroplus_prevalence(
  sex = c(1, 2),
  age_in_months = rpois(100, 100),
  height_in_cm = rnorm(100, 100, 10),
  weight_in_kg = rnorm(100, 40, 10)
)[, c(1, 4, 5, 6)]
```

Using the function `with` it is easy to apply `anthroplus_prevalence` to a
full dataset.

To look at all parameters, type `?anthroplus_prevalence`.

### Contributions

Contributions in the form of issues are very welcome. In particular if you
find any bugs or cannot reproduce results obtained with other implementations.
